#Note: 
- Inside this folder contains the general theme for the site.
- I wasn't able to figure out how to have one file for sidebar and top navigation bar
so we'll need to copy and paste the template and add our design.

### Files:
- ./NavBarsTemplate.html: Contains the general layout for the site
- ./css/navigation.css: Contains the general styling for the sidebar and top navigation bar

### Misc:
- If you have an easier way, just let everyone know.
- Let me know if you want me to clarify things.
